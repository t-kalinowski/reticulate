## Overview

[RStudio v1.2](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) brings support for the reticulate package, including:

1) Support for executing reticulated Python chunks within [R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).

2) Line-by-line execution of Python code using the reticulate `repl_python()` function.

3) Sourcing Python scripts using the reticulate `source_python()` function.

4) Code completion and inline help for Python. 

5) Display of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) plots within both notebook and console execution modes.

A note about the philosophy behind Python tools within RStudio: these tools are not intended for standalone Python work but rather explicitly aimed at the *integration of Python into R projects* (and as such are closely tied to the reticulate package). 

There are many IDEs available for doing data science with Python including [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), [Rodeo](https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo), [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python), and we strongly recommend using one of them for Python-only projects. However, if you are using reticulated Python within an R project then RStudio provides a set of tools that we think you will find extremely helpful.

## Installation

You can download the latest RStudio release here: <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>.

All of the features described below require that you have previously installed the reticulate package, which you can do as follows:

```r
install.packages("reticulate")
```

## R Notebooks

R Notebooks have been enhanced to support executing Python chunks using the reticulate Python engine. For example:

### matplotlib

R Notebooks can also display matplotlib plots inline when they are printed from Python chunks:

## Line-by-Line Execution

You can execute code from Python scripts line-by-line using the **Run** button (or Control+Enter) in the same way as you execute R code line-by-line. RStudio will automatically switch into reticulate's `repl_python()` mode whenever you execute lines from a Python script:

Type `exit` from the Python REPL to exit back into R (RStudio will also automatically switch back to R mode whenever you execute code from an R script).

## Sourcing Scripts

Click the editor's **Source Script** button within a Python source file to execute a script using reticulate's `source_python()` function:

## Completion and Help

RStudio now provides code completion for Python scripts:

Additionally, pressing the F1 button over a Python symbol will display the help topic for that symbol:
